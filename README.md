# Google Data Analytics Capstone: Bellabeat Case Study Analysis
Analysing smart device fitness data for a fictional company, Bellabeat, from the [Google Data Analytics Course Capstone](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone). As an acting Junior Data Analyst within the marketing analyst team for the wellness company, which is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women, I am tasked with analysing current smart device fitness data to unlock new growth opportunities through these trends for the firm. 
The public data set that I will be using is from a specific data set, [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit), made available through [Mobius](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic).
Therefore, as mentioned in the case study, my objective is to provide the company with high-level recommendations of how the studied trends can better the marketing strategy.

### Goals:
The goals for the case study can be summarised as below:
1. Observe trends through customer data on other similar smart fitness devices.
2. Note down which of these observed trends can apply to Bellabeat users.
3. Utilise relevant data to assist Bellabeat in their marketing strategy using their smart devices.

## Introduction - About Bellabeat
Bellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused smart products for women that informs and inspires its global customer base by collecting and channeling data from daily tasks, such as daily activities, sleeping schedules, stress levels, and reproductive health. The company's products, which have been extensively marketed through traditional and digital media, has also opened offices internationally and launched multiple products. Bellabeat has heavily-invested in traditional and digital media channels, including and not limited to radios, billboards, print and TV, year-round investments in Google Search with active Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages.
Therefore, by using the information from available consumer data, the founders of the company are confident in identifying trends to implement in their marketing strategies.

For this case study, I will follow the steps of the data analysis process, namely, [Ask](#ask), [Prepare](#prepare), [Process](#process), [Analyse](#analyse), [Share](#share), and [Act](#act)

## Ask
### Business Task
Analysing smart device usage data to gain insight into how consumers use non-bellabeat smart fitness devices to help the process of the marketing strategy for Bellabeat to grow as a global player.

The key stakeholders for the above business tasks are:
1. <b>Primary Stakeholders</b>: Urška Sršen and Sando Mur
2. <b>Secondary Stakeholders</b>: The marketing analytics team

## Prepare
The data set used for this case study contains the personal data of 30 eligible FitBit users, who have all consented to the submission of their personal Tracker Data. As mentioned above, the downloaded zipped public data set, [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit), was stored in a separate folder, labelled Bellabeat - Case Study 2 under the Google Data Analytics Capstone folder on my local computer.

The available data is in wide format, and partially follows the ROCCC approach:
1. Reliability: The data set is from 30 FitBit users who have all consented to the submission of their personal Tracker Data, including minute-level output data for their physical activity.
2. Original: This data set was generated by customer responses from a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between March 2016 to May 2016.
3. Comprehensive: 30 eligible consumers' fitness data covers details such as minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It also includes
information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate.
4. Current: The data set is not current as of this day, which poses as an additional issue.
5. Cited: Other than the known generator of this data, namely Amazon Mechanical Turk, the citation of the data remains unknown.

Furthermore, we make note of other issues:
- As there are only 30 users from whom data has been extracted, the marketing analytics team will not be able to make accurate decisions for the company's strategy. For instance, the central limit theorem states that we would require a sample size that is n &ge; 30, which would allow us to implement the t-test for statistical analysis. For the purposes of better recommendations, it is always preferred to work with a larger data set.
- Skimming through the files before analysing the available data, I found that there were differing number of unique IDs of consumers using non-bellabeat smart products. A few files contained unique consumer IDs that were either &gt; or &lt; 30 (such as the dailyActivity_merged.csv file in this folder). This was measured using the ```COUNTUNIQUE()``` function on Google Sheets
- Some of the data that was collected was also observed from Tuesday to Thursday, which would not produce accurate enough results for the analysis.

### Process
After downloading the data set, I loaded and installed the necessary packages on RStudio using Posit Cloud. As mentioned in the case study, which mainly examines daily activity, sleep, and weight, I will focus on:
- dailyActivity_merged.csv
- sleepDay_merged.csv
- weightLogInfo_merged.csv
- hourlySteps_merged.csv

I will be altering the filenames for ease of recognition and working. Before beginning to analyse the files, I examined the available data using the ```str()``` function and found the following:
